<h2>Heading 1</h2>
<p>Make a <a href="https://plot.ly/r/">plotly</a> plot in the chunk below. Because we are using the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">bookdown</a> extension to rmarkdown we can cross reference all of our figures and tables.We do this like this:</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:plot">1</a> shows an example of a javascript plot using the graphing package ‘plotly’. We know that this plot is called <code>(fig:plot)</code> because the chunk in which it is made is named is labelled <code>plot</code>. Because we are cross referencing a figure we know it needs to have <code>fig:</code> in front of the label, hence <code>(fig:plot)</code>.</p>
